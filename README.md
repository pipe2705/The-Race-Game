How to staart the game? 

   1-  As a user I open up the game and I want to understand how to play. 
        The main screen has a simple box indicating they must press the space bar to activate the game and start playing 

Once started, What do I do? 

    2- As a User once the space bar is activated I want to continue to increase my points. The user will continue to actuate the space bar and increase their points. At the same time they see the points being generated by the computer. 

Who is Winning? 

    3- As a user I want to know who is winning with the goal to understand what my position is vs the CPU. As the user presses the space bar they will see 2 bars on the right pane of the screen which shows their progress and the progress of their competitor.

Once the Finish line is reached what happens?

    4-As a user I want to understand what happens when there is a winner. Once the user or the the CPU reaches the finish line the game will stop and an alert on the screen will announce the winner. The user will aknowledge the alert and the page will show the overall points. 

How do I restart? 
    5- As a user I would like to play the game again! because it's amazing of course.... After 20 seconds of aknowledging the previously seen alert the screen will automatically reload. Alternatively a button on the lower left side of the screen will allow the game to be reloaded manually where they will return to the opening page of the game.
